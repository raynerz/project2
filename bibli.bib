abstract={Retinal layer thickness measurement offers important information for reliable diagnosis of retinal diseases and for the evaluation of disease development and medical treatment responses. This task critically depends on the accurate edge detection of the retinal layers in OCT images. Here, we intended to search for the most suitable edge detectors for the retinal OCT image segmentation task. The three most promising edge detection algorithms were identified in the related literature: Canny edge detector, the two-pass method, and the EdgeFlow technique. The quantitative evaluation results show that the two-pass method outperforms consistently the Canny detector and the EdgeFlow technique in delineating the retinal layer boundaries in the OCT images. In addition, the mean localization deviation metrics show that the two-pass method caused the smallest edge shifting problem. These findings suggest that the two-pass method is the best among the three algorithms for detecting retinal layer boundaries. The overall better performance of Canny and two-pass methods over EdgeFlow technique implies that the OCT images contain more intensity gradient information than texture changes along the retinal layer boundaries. The results will guide our future efforts in the quantitative analysis of retinal OCT images for the effective use of OCT technologies in the field of ophthalmology.},

abstract = "Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons and somas, ultimately preventing light signals in the retina from reaching the brain. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the world, and treatment options for patients remain limited and minimally efficacious. A number of mechanisms have been linked to glaucomatous pathophysiology. A leading role is now attributed to neuroinflammatory conditions generated by the resident innate immune cells in the optic nerve and retina. Since the eye is immune privileged, the adaptation of these innate immune cells, termed glia, is crucial following trauma. In this chapter, we discuss the mechanisms associated with normal glial function in a healthy eye, and how changes in glial activation can contribute to the process of glaucomatous neurodegeneration in both the optic nerve and retina."

abstract = "Bruch's membrane (BM) is a unique pentalaminar structure, which is strategically located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the fenestrated choroidal capillaries of the eye. BM is an elastin- and collagen-rich extracellular matrix that acts as a molecular sieve. BM partly regulates the reciprocal exchange of biomolecules, nutrients, oxygen, fluids and metabolic waste products between the retina and the general circulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the molecular, structural and functional properties of BM are dependent on age, genetic constitution, environmental factors, retinal location and disease state. As a result, part of the properties of BM are unique to each human individual at a given age, and therefore uniquely affect the development of normal vision and ocular disease. The changes occurring in BM with age include increased calcification of elastic fibres, increased cross-linkage of collagen fibres and increased turnover of glycosaminoglycans. In addition, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and fat accumulate in BM. These age-related changes may not only influence the normal age-related health of photoreceptor cells, but also the onset and progression of diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Undoubtedly, BM is the site of drusen development. Confluent drusen and uncontrolled activation of the complement cascade are most likely the first signs of AMD. Furthermore, the nature of adhesive interactions between the RPE and BM are instrumental in the development of retinal detachments and proliferative retinal disease. Finally, BM is passively or actively involved in a range of other retinal disorders such as Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), Sorsby's Fundus Dystrophy and Malattia Leventinese. Here, we review the dynamic nature of Bruch's membrane, from molecule to man, during development, aging and disease. We propose a simple and straightforward nomenclature for BM deposits. Finally, we attempt to correlate recently published mRNA expression profiles of the RPE and choroid with molecular, structural and functional properties of BM. Our review may shed light on the complex involvement of BM in retinal pathology, notably age-related macular degeneration."

   abstract = {Monitoring subtle choroidal thickness changes in the human eye delivers insight into the pathogenesis of various ocular diseases such as myopia and helps planning their treatment. However, a thorough evaluation of detection-performance is challenging as a ground truth for comparison is not available. Alternatively, an artificial ground truth can be generated by averaging the manual expert segmentations. This makes the ground truth very sensitive to ambiguities due to different interpretations by the experts. In order to circumvent this limitation, we present a novel validation approach that operates independently from a ground truth and is uniquely based on the common agreement between algorithm and experts. Utilizing an appropriate index, we compare the joint agreement of several raters with the algorithm and validate it against manual expert segmentation. To illustrate this, we conduct an observational study and evaluate the results obtained using our previously published registration-based method. In addition, we present an adapted state-of-the-art evaluation method, where a paired t-test is carried out after leaving out the results of one expert at the time. Automated and manual detection were performed on a dataset of 90 OCT 3D-volume stack pairs of healthy subjects between 8 and 18 years of age from Asian urban regions with a high prevalence of myopia.},

abstract={The assessment of choroidal thickness from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the human choroid is an important clinical and research task, since it provides valuable information regarding the eye's normal anatomy and physiology, and changes associated with various eye diseases and the development of refractive error. Due to the time consuming and subjective nature of manual image analysis, there is a need for the development of reliable objective automated methods of image segmentation to derive choroidal thickness measures. However, the detection of the two boundaries which delineate the choroid is a complicated and challenging task, in particular the detection of the outer choroidal boundary, due to a number of issues including: (i) the vascular ocular tissue is non-uniform and rich in non-homogeneous features, and (ii) the boundary can have a low contrast. In this paper, an automatic segmentation technique based on graph-search theory is presented to segment the inner choroidal boundary (ICB) and the outer choroidal boundary (OCB) to obtain the choroid thickness profile from OCT images. Before the segmentation, the B-scan is pre-processed to enhance the two boundaries of interest and to minimize the artifacts produced by surrounding features. The algorithm to detect the ICB is based on a simple edge filter and a directional weighted map penalty, while the algorithm to detect the OCB is based on OCT image enhancement and a dual brightness probability gradient. The method was tested on a large data set of images from a pediatric (1083 B-scans) and an adult (90 B-scans) population, which were previously manually segmented by an experienced observer. The results demonstrate the proposed method provides robust detection of the boundaries of interest and is a useful tool to extract clinical data.},
